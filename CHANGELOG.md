# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Created the QuaiLinux live-build profile for Debian Trixie.
- Added KDE Plasma as the default desktop environment.
- Added Calamares and Debian Calamares settings to the live image.
- Added the `Install QuaiLinux` desktop/menu launcher.
- Added the QuaiLinux icon and wallpaper assets.
- Added default KDE dark theme settings using Breeze Dark.
- Added default KDE wallpaper configuration for live users.
- Added QuaiLinux OS branding through `/usr/lib/os-release`,
  `/etc/os-release`, `/etc/issue`, `/etc/motd`, and hostname defaults.
- Added live-user sudo and polkit rules so installer startup can request
  privileges.
- Added boot menu branding for QuaiLinux live boot entries.
- Added ARM64 live ISO build support and verified an ARM64 UEFI ISO build.
- Added an older netinst/preseed experiment for internet-based KDE installs.

### Changed

- Hid the Debian Calamares desktop launcher and routed it to the QuaiLinux
  launcher to avoid duplicate visible installer icons.
- Renamed live boot entries from generic Debian live labels to QuaiLinux labels.
- Set ISO metadata to QuaiLinux, including the `QUAILINUX_LIVE` volume ID.

### Known Issues

- Calamares is included, branded, and wired to the launcher, but the installer is
  not working reliably yet. The installer modules and live-to-disk flow still
  need testing and fixes before QuaiLinux can be considered installable.

### Build Output

- Produced a verified ARM64 live ISO locally:
  `quailinux-live-13.5.0-arm64-calamares-fixed.iso`.
- Generated ISO artifacts are not committed to Git because they are large build
  outputs.
